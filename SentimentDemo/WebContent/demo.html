	<textarea id="textInputArea" rows="45" cols="50">My niece from Wisconsin and I took a road trip to Nevada. It was her first time going to Vegas. Before we got to the Vegas strip we stopped to have breakfast in a city called Henderson. There was a plaza with Starbucks, bagel shop, baskin robbins, and more. It was a nice plaza. We noticed people coming out with bags of bagels from Henderson Fresh Bakery. I must say this has been my first bagel shop where I enjoyed eating the Loax bagel. My niece got a muffin and a few eclairs. The muffin was very tasty and the eclairs were to die for. :) Will be coming back soon :)))</textarea>

<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well!   The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!    Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Wonderful authentic food! The salsas are amazing!!  The server Stephanie was fantastic! Great service, very knowledgable & friendly!  She made me & my twin boys feel so welcome!! We will be back!!!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Pleasant surprise for brunch! Maybe one of the best brunches I've had in ages. Unique flavors and good service. I highly recommend!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>This restaurant deserves more recognition because it's one of the best places I've ever eaten at. It has excellent food and the customer service is outstanding!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Delicious tacos. We found this place on yelp when we were visiting Vegas and it did not disappoint. Friendly, personable owner and unbelievably good food. I had the carne Asada taco with guac, sour cream and cheese, it was my favorite authentic taco I have ever eaten. Seasoned to perfection. My husband and son had the Jr. burritos with carne asada and my daughter a delicious generous size quesadilla. We we're all impressed. The side of rice and beans was 2.00 and so good. Reasonable price for families. Don't miss this place if your in Vegas! For Real!!!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>It's taken me awhile to get around to writing the well deserved review about Burrito Boyz in Port Credit. You're probably wondering why I would even bother, given the fact that they've got locations all over and 'it's just another chain.'  This location is so much more than that as the current owners are a group of former employees who've taken it over and while maintaining the brand image have made it there own and made it a smashing success! I would challenge you to visit any day around lunch and not have to contend with a line up of hungry patrons. This place is crazy popular in PC!  My pro-tip: Do away with the standard chicken/beef/pork options and opt for something on the healthy side - ask for the pan fried hali (halibut) on a whole wheat tortilla as a healthy choice. They also have a sweet-potato burrito for you vegetarian fans who are tired of a tortilla filled with just veggie toppings!  Located on the north side of Stavebank off of Lakeshore</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Get the chili! Get the chili! Get the chili! One of the few places. West of Kansas that chili isn't all beans. If fact it's real chili. No beans. Comes with a cornbread topper and hot sauce on the side. I personally dump it all in.  Get the chili!  Btw the other stuff looks good too.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Wow, this was the best buffet my husband & I have ever been to. Bottomless cocktails for just 12.99, and the best selection and freshness I've ever seen at a buffet. I will come back whenever I'm in Vegas from now on. We had multiple people tell us that Aria's buffet didn't compare to others on the strip (namely Bellagio) so we went to see for ourselves and we were not impressed. The buffet at Aria blew all others out of the water! We actually opted to eat here twice during our stay because we were so happy with it. No obnoxious lines, friendly staff who kept the drinks coming and our table clean. We mainly filled up on crab, seafood & the meat carving station but everything we tried was great. Very fresh and very tasty. The dessert bar was impressive with some very unique and delicious gelato flavors to try. I can't wait to come back and bring my mom because she will be blown away. Much love to the buffet at Aria, you guys are the bomb!!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Love it for lunch!  This is by far my favorite lunchtime spot.  Their flatbreads are great.  The arugula and prosciutto flatbread is like a pizza and salad in one.  Anything with the meatballs is tasty. I haven't ever had anything here I didn't like.  The service is usually efficient, but never knocks my socks off.  The ambiance would be great for a romantic dinner.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>I heard about this place on a local radio station. They were mentioning the top pizza places in throughout the nation. Nora's took first place and of course, being the pizza lover I am, I had to try this place. After finally planning our Vegas trip I said we had to try this place before we left to see if its really the #1 best pizza in the USA (San Diego took #2 woohoo). We got there exactly at the time they opened to beat the lunch crowd. At first it was empty, but immediately got packed for the lunch hour.  We already know what we wanted since we had browsed through the menu on their website. After being seated, the bus boy offered us water along with any other beverage. A few minutes later, our waitress greeted us with fresh garlic bread (Which was to die for!!) We started off with a Caesar Salad then ordered our pizza. We went for the Snow White pizza and added mushrooms and prosciutto (per hubby's request). I must say this is probably the best pizza I've ever had. The ricotta on the pizza was so fresh it would melt in your mouth. The dough was just perfect. Not too heavy, not too doughy, not too thin, not too thick. I'm usually not too crazy about prosciutto, its just too salty for me to enjoy, but this one was perfect!! It had the right texture, not too chewy or salty. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and I can totally see myself coming back if I'm ever in Vegas again.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Love this place! Went to the one @ Venetian for Chicken & Waffles after the club. Then again for breakfast. I recommend the red velvet pancakes, mocha & eggs benedict.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Our recent visit back did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and personable, and they are patient with my kids. My husband loves the ice cream cakes and my kids - just love it!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Premium drinks. Whether I'm in need for caffeine boost or a relaxing personalized and seasonal cocktail. Have always been so pleased with their product!  Food and pastry selections never disappoint.  It's not surprising that this place is busting at the seams busy but I can't say that I've ever felt neglected or that their quality of service/product has suffered!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Really great breakfast! Everything was fresh and fast. The staff is incredibly nice, even offered coffee to go and made it iced!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>My niece from Wisconsin and I took a road trip to Nevada. It was her first time going to Vegas. Before we got to the Vegas strip we stopped to have breakfast in a city called Henderson. There was a plaza with Starbucks, bagel shop, baskin robbins, and more. It was a nice plaza.   We noticed people coming out with bags of bagels from Henderson Fresh Bakery. I must say this has been my first bagel shop where I enjoyed eating the Loax bagel. My niece got a muffin and a few eclairs. The muffin was very tasty and the eclairs were to die for. :)  Will be coming back soon :)))</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>My husband and I are always on the hunt for yummy sweet treats. We found this gem at the farmer's market we frequent. After numerous times passing it by (I'm a cupcake snob) he talked me into trying a red velvet and a smores cupcake and they were perfectly moist and delicious! The following week we tried the chocolate chunk cookies and a pumpkin smore, the cookies were so soft and chewy, yum! Yesterday I tried more chocolate chunk cookies (I may have bought nearly her whole stack) and a pumpkin monster cookie, so freakin' good. I love how her desserts are the perfect amount of sweetness, she doesn't over do the sugar. We are fans! Even me, the cupcake snob!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>I was pleasantly surprised by Delmonico's. The service was great, the food tasty and the pricing was reasonable compared to other steak houses.  They even offered sides with the meal, when so many of the steak houses offer everything  a la cart.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Fantastic food and beautiful atmosphere.  The Rocky Road dessert is delicious and magical!!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>When my boyfriend told me he wanted to eat a $60 burger, I thought he had lost his mind. Who would pay that much for a burger? Well, after having it, we would, that's who.   This burger is decadent. So decadent, that I would suggest splitting it. We sat at the bar. Ordered a beer on tap, ordered a side of fries and the $60 burger split.   The place was casual, fun and we genuinely had a good time eating that burger and hanging out at this restaurant.   If your in LV, then your probably thinking your going to spend some money anyway. If you like meat, and your not opposed to spending your money on a really expensive burger, I say this is a must try.   Enjoy!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>My first time here, it was great! The best breadsticks I've ever tried! I also had the buffalo woogie...excellent. Definitely will be back!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Delicious and convenient for Henderson peeps!! The sushi is delicious, the Lemon Roll has a great light and fresh flavor.  Also try the Secret Weapon Roll....trust me on this one! Get the 20 piece sashimi plate ...can't go wrong on this one. Desert? Definitely the Funkler. Put this place in your list, great atmosphere too love it.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>I just want to thank the team at Primanti Bros. for hosting my twins 4th birthday lunch.  They were professional and reasonable from start to finish.  First, they were very responsive to emails about reserving space for about 25 people.  Management helped me negotiate any dilemmas, including calling ahead a partial order so some food was ready for the kids close to our arrival.  Also, they allowed me to drop off a large Costco birthday cake the day before and hold it in their fridge for nearly 24 hours.  When we arrived, they had set things up in a back room to be "party ready" with a special table for the appetizers, and later, a special table for the cake.  The two waiters who worked with us were very attentive and rolled very well with the chaos that can come from a 4-year-old birthday party!  Finally, the whole experience was VERY affordable.  Let's just say I have spent almost as much taking my girlfriend out to The Cheesecake Factory as I did making 25 people happy here.  While the food here (and generally all Primanti Bros.) is always a solid 3-4 stars, the experience they provided my family and our guests hit 5 starts yesterday.  If you are looking for a good place for a kids' birthday party, I suggest here!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>Came here for dinner and it was great. Even though we didn't get seated immediately, we waited shortly while we had a good time having drinks by the window with a great view. Once we were seated we actually had to waiters who were good at suggesting different meals since it was our first time.   I had the bourbon filet mignon and the twined baked potatoes. The steak was perfectly cooked and I think the baked potatoes was the best I've ever had in my life lol...yea a little dramatic but it was that good. She had the steak and asparagus. She loved it.   We had a great time!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>I would seriously recommend not eating breakfast if you get the lunch special here. Its pretty affordable at $25. I love the steak and buffet styles sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="green"><b>Positive</b></font> </td><td>MAYYYYYNNNN these guys are the REAL DEAL. First bit is that the place makes u feel like uve stepped into another country, Love the decor and the feelin. Food is AMAZING!! Its AUTHENTIC mexican food, So DAMN GOOD. Ordered the Fish Tacos, Beef Chimichanga and Green Enchiladas! I am definitely sold and will be returning again. Its a great spot and it makes me want to put on a mexican bad boy hat and do a DANCE! You can trust me on this one.</td></tr>
	


<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>They put at least 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise on a turkey club, possibly to mask the dryness of the very stale and crumbling bun. The sliced tomatoes were way past their sell by date, and the club had only enough turkey for half a sandwich. The jalapeno bites were good,  but would have been much better If they were hot, they were barely warm. The drink was all ice. That's what you get when you order their 2 dinners for $10 special - really bad food. If you go inside, you will be treated to the rudest employees you'll ever encounter, anywhere. They said I should have ordered it without mayonnaise. I said you're right. And I also should have ordered it a week ago, when the bun was fresh. I would never recommend this restaurant, and I will never take my family there again.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>I ate here once for a retirement dinner for a friend, and once was enough.  The place was nasty dirty, the tables (that you eat on....) were the worst.  The pizza was pretty bad ( Eatza Pizza, Ci Cis, etc level) and to be honest I have had frozen pizzas that were better.  I find it disheartening that so many people rate this place based completely on the novelty, as I would rather have great food in a bland place then horrible food in a dirty place with a gimmick.   With all the diverse places and interesting food choices we have in this city, paying for really bad overpriced pizza in a place that they don't even bother to clean is silly - even if they do have a Organ.  And they only take cash? Seriously? My landscape guy even has a credit card machine in his truck, so why can't this place accept debit/credit?  Bottom line, ignore the novelty - if you want pizza go to Spinatos or Mellow Mushroom.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>This is the slowest chipotle ever. I live in the area, so I go to this Chipotle a lot & there is always a line no matter what time of day it is and you should expect to wait at least 30 minutes on average. Not sure what the manager of this place is doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>I strongly discourage anyone from going to Mana Bar. The inside is crowded, filthy, and small. The price is much higher than it should be for such a run-down place. The crowd is mainly (over 75%) older creepy men who just watch other people dancing. The staff is rude and quite frankly violent with customers, and upon hearing any complaint they will simply try to have the customer leave the bar. Customer service is absolutely not a priority. Once you pay your overpriced cover, the manager could not care less what happens to you inside or how his staff treats you.  Avoid this place! You can easily find cheaper and nicer places in the area.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>The food was absolutely terrible. I mean the meat was as non fresh as it could get. The staff sucked. Terrible place. It is ashame it was so terrible because it is in a good location. From Long Island, and I will make sure to find a better place next visit.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>I live within walking distance from Zocalo and have tried to like this place again and again throughout the years.. with no success. The atmosphere makes me wish I liked the food.. which is a continuous disappointment. The margarita menu is enticing, but the drinks themselves are disappointing. I have ordered food myself numerous times, usually with a party of 4+.. and have never heard anyone give a compliment to their meal.  If you're looking for trendy/modern Mexican, it is well worth the 15 minute drive east to  Lopez in Cleveland Heights or 5 minutes west to Momocho in Ohio City. I love the concept of a cool, modern Mexican restaurant.. and wish I could find I good one on E.4th Street.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>So nice to see the new I-Hop location at Cotswald and I had the opportunity to visit last weekend with two other adults a newborn and 6 year old.  The waitress was super sweet.  Our order and meal went well and the food was tastey.  However I waited forever for my check.  I asked another server to let my waitress know I needed my check  but saw she had been seated a second table.  So I waited.  Then I got up and went to the kitchen door.  The other waiter came thru and said do you want to start tomorrow jokingly :) and then said she didn't come over yet??? and I said no.  So I go back to my table.  I then see the waitress at the computer assuming maybe she is preparing my check.  Wait. wait. wait.  Others at the table are getting annoyed too.  So I take my two pancakes on a plate up to the waitress.  I said I would like a box and my check please.  She is lost in a fog.  I said please get me a box and my check.  Again lost in fog.  I hand the plate to her and said I will meet you up front at the register.  I tipped her too and I really don't know why.  Should it take 2 hours to eat in an empty restuarant?   What I really meant to say was are you supposed to wait for an hour after you eat to get the check??</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>This place is a joke. We had a wrap party for a TV show here and the security/door people were a bunch of rude kids talking crap about how people were dressed and looked. Good luck employing arrogant bully's!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>I'm a Walmart fan and I can only say this, the main water fountains at this location was out for several weeks. It's not necessarily located in a savory part of town, but the prices were the same inside as they would be anywhere else so...   They had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>Outback is normally one of my favorite place to grab some chicken wings from. This was my first time at this actual location:  -I asked the hostess can we sit by the window, she walked us all the way towards to kitchen, I was totally confused about that!  -the waitress: "Nancy" wasn't too friendly, seemed like she didn't want to be there.  -I attempted to order all flats for my wings and the waitress stated they no longer can do all flats.   -I order a salmon salad, my salmon was raw AND my salad had hair in it :(  -the bread x butter was the only thing that was good & we still left a tip</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>Booster Juice is probably the worst "smoothie" or "juice bar" I've ever been to.  The biggest problem is how deceptive the descriptions are on their menu.  They lead you to believe that the smoothie you order contains lots of different kinds of fruit when in reality it's usually one piddly handful of frozen berries and a bunch of super-sweet juices all mixed together with ice and sorbet.  Less juice, more fruit is what I would like to see.  And don't even get me started on the morons running this place -- what kind of place closes by 6PM on a Saturday on the hottest day of the summertime?  Booster Juice, that's who.  Your hours suck.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>Two management groups, bad food, I can go on for days. This place needs to be closed down. You can't keep putting lipstick on the same pig.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>Rude bartender. My friend and I stop in for drinks at the bar regularly. They used to have a nice guy bartend the front. Lately it's a girl who is not the nicest. She has a bad attitude and never smiles. We go in a lot and she pretends like she's never seen us before.  Think her name is Jessica?  Manager kinda walks around but doesn't acknowledge customers or ask how their evening is going.   Not a happy atmosphere. Food is good, drinks are good. I will say though, their Moscow Mules are not that good. I get a better buzz off the ones at Oreganos and they are also cheaper.   Encountered an extremely creepy man at the bar. He was harassing my friend and I a few months ago and the bartender girl told us to be nice to him because he is a regular. Extremely inappropriate. He tried to assault someone in the parking lot that evening. As a customer I felt completely infuriated that she would tell us to be nicer to him when he was harassing us by being inappropriate, making a scene, and making us look bad by association since the bartender asked us to be nice to him. It was super uncomfortable after that. We soon closed out our tab and never went back.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>This place is horrible they have the longest wait . They took up half of my work break to give me hot chocolate then the cashier forgot my lemon bread then told me to hold it while she give me a plate. Like the lemon bread was a rock or sheet of paper. Unprofessional!!</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>I cannot beleive this place is still open and relatively busy... It is unedible. The food is of poor quality, the kitchen is dirty. An open kitchen should be kept clean, considering that is the first thing people look at!  The service is good, but that cannot redempt the food. I can't even understand how people think this is italian food.   The pizza is actually not terrible, but not good either... The kind you find in a food court.   The pasta is horrendous. The tomatoe sauce tastes like it was pre-packaged and served straight from a can.   The appetizers were not fresh... Mozzarella was dry and the cold cuts had an unhealthy funk... I had to spit it out. Waiter did not ask why our plate remained untouched, and to be honest, I did not feel like making a big case out of it because he was so nice.  To avoid at all cost: the sausage. I don't know where that "meat" comes from, but I think that you can get serious food poisoning from ingesting that stuff.   Will never go back.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>Burger was over cooked and both my friend's and my burgers were nasty soggy. Frys had no flavor. Server forgot my order of chips & salsa but tried to keep it on my bill. She also forgot my friend's guacamole and also tried to charge him for it. Gave us attitude when we questioned it. Place is dirty and lame.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>These cupcakes are extremely nasty. They taste like they are made from a box mix. I can buy 4 boxes of mix for the cost of 1 cupcake. Me thinks not. The cake is extremely dry and the icing is overly sweet, in my opinion. There are other cupcake places in town that are miles better than this one is.  I wouldnt recommend this place to a person without a tongue.</td></tr>
<tr><td> <font color="red"><b>Negative</b></font> </td><td>Gave this a try and did not enjoy the food one bit. Upon entering I could smell a heavy stench of oil. I let that pass since the average yelp review was pretty high, maybe the food would be better. Ordered the Tuna Tataki which had a burnt taste to each piece. Also ordered the sushi platter and each piece of sushi was tough. Wanted to really like this place because it got great reviews. The staff was nice and friendly though.</td></tr>
